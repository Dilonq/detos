## Introduction
I chose to do my project on the Great Plains because of how little I knew about it, and how maybe by choosing it as the focus of my project I could learn more about it. As it turns out, there are **a lot** of animals that live there, which I suppose makes sense considering it mostly consists of grass.

## Characteristics
+ Climate: Great Plains have a continental climate. Winters are cold and summers are hot. It is very windy, with low humidity.
+ Temperature: The average range of temperatures in the Great Plains go from 40ºF to 70ºF, with the most extreme ranging from -70ºF all the way up to 121ºF.
+ Precipitation: Precipitation ranges from just 15 inches to extremes of 50. On average however, it is 35 inches.
+ Seasons: The Great Plains has the standard four seasons, which you should know.
+ Location: The Great Plains are located in central America, not that anyone wants to be in America right now.

## The Animals
+ Bison - Please tell me you know what a Bison is

+ Mesquite - A name used for multiple plants in the genus Prosopis, consisting of over 40 species
+ Sagebrush - A name used for multiple herbaceus[^2] and "woody" species of plants, all in the genus Artemisia.

## Threats

According to the first website that came up when I googled it, the biggest threat by far the Great Plains is "plow-up". Plow-up is the conversion of the Great Plains into farmland. Fortunately, this threat is being fixed as much less land is being coverted per year, with 2.5 million acres in 2016, but only 1.7 million acres in 2017. On average, 1.5 million acres of the Great Plains have been lost since 2009. With any luck, or if every human dies of the coronavirus, the Great Plains can be restored to it's former glory.

## Visitation

###### me in the great plains ^^

As of now, there is no reason whatsoever to travel to the Great Plains, as the current situation in America puts you at a severe risk of death, considering the coronavirus. If you *do* feel like risking your life then there are many reasons to visit the Great Plains. Some of these reasons include:

+ Lots of space - Have you ever felt like you need more elbow room to do things? Well, I sure haven't, but in the case that you do, there is a ton of room in the Great Plains.
+ Hunting & Poaching - There are lots of animals in the Great Plains, which as you might have expected can net you quite a bit of money.[^3]
+ Walk around aimlessly - Sure, you might get lost, but its pretty peaceful to just walk around in the Great Plains.
+ Walk around and look at this cool place ↓ ![this place](thisplace.jpg)
+ Visit Mt. Rushmore - I mean, who *wouldn't* want to go see a big cliff with people's faces carved into it.
+ Visit a Corn Palace - For some reason, people thought it might be a cool idea to build lots of murals out of corn.
